# CoffeeBean
A game that I am currently developing in Unity.

You play as a coffee shop Barista, whose job it is to take orders and make coffee for customers.

The game cycle if you make coffee for customers. Upgrade or fix equipment repeat.

I wanted to keep this game simple as it is the first time I have tackled something like this before.
The main inspirations came from my time working as a waiter in a specialty coffee shop in dubai, and I thought it would fill a gap in the games market in an area that is not really that populated with other titles.
