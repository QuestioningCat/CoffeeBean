# CoffeeBean

A game that I am currently developing in Unity.

You play as a coffee shop Barista, whos job it is to take orders and makre coffee for customers.

The game cycle if make coffee for customers. Upgrade or fix equipment repeat.

I wanted  to keep this game simple as it is the first time I have tackled something like this before. 

The main insparations came from my time working as a waiter in a speciality coffee shop in dubai, and I thought it would fill a gap in the games market in an area that is not really that populated with other titles.
